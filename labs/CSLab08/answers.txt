1. Did you put in all comments in your code? If not, credits will be deducted.

    yes

2. Why does not the iterator class have destructor?

    pointer p always points to an existing node in IntArray. It
    does not need to create a node, nor destroy a node

3. What is the syntax difference between dereferencing operator * overloading and
multiplication operator * overloading?

    //dereference operator
    A operator *() { /*...*/ };
    //multiply operator           
    A operator *(const A&) { /*...*/ };

4. Why can not use the address of last node + 1 in container.end() function?

    there is not an address for the end() it is just used by the container so you can't use it like that

5. In our implementation, if the linked list is empty, the container.end() returns an iterator
with the member pointer p nullptr. Would this cause problem?

    no? i dont think it does

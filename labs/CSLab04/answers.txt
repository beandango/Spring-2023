1. Did you copy the comments from demo program to your own? If not, points will be
deducted.
    Yes
2. Why should the program initialize scoreNumber to 0 and scores to nullptr in constructors?
Can they be initialized somewhere else?
    When scoreNumber is 0, there basically is no
    array, so we dont want scores to be allocated
    to some random address. You probably can just not initialize them until you need them,
    but that might make it less readable
3. The member function freeMemory() is placed in private section. Why?
    It's an internal function. There's no need
    for it to not be private, so, it's private.
4. In step 2, we see the behavior of cs2, previousCS2 and nextCS2 is not desired. The program
crashed at the end. Please explain
    memberwise assignment made cs2.scores, previouscs2.scores,
    and nextcs2.score point to the same array.
    So, when cs2 is destroyed, allocated memory is freed. 
    And then when previouscs2 and nextcs2 try to 
    free their memory, well, its pointing to the 
    one that was already freed.
5. When member variables contain pointers, what a class must have?
    Destructor, overloaded = operator, copy constructor
